# TOP_rockPaperScissors
Sep 20th, 2022
This is my first full javascript program via The Odin Project. It was
    definitely challenging, but figuring it out has actually been very
    fun. It seems like I may be adding DOM later on and doing some more
    with the program itself, but this is it for now. 

So far, this program essentially takes a computer generated input of 
    3 items in an array (rock, paper and scissors), and compares that
    choice against a player typed-out input. The program then displays
    a message stating who won that round, as well as keeps track of
    the score throughout 5 rounds of play, and announces a winner at the
    end of the 5 rounds.
